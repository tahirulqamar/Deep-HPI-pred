<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Deep-HPI-pred is a robust web-based application designed to aid researchers in studying host-pathogen interactions using advanced computational approaches. By integrating state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms with an intuitive graphical user interface, it provides a comprehensive platform for both detection and visualization of host-pathogen interaction networks.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Detect Host-Pathogen Interaction Networks: Our application uses advanced deep learning algorithms to predict host-pathogen interactions with high accuracy. Upload your data, and Deep-HPI-pred will analyze it, detecting potential interaction networks based on the information provided.</li>
<li>Visualize Interaction Networks: Deep-HPI-pred doesn't just detect interaction networks; it also provides tools to visualize them. This allows researchers to better understand the complexities of host-pathogen interactions.</li>
<li>Generate Hypotheses: By using Deep-HPI-pred, researchers can generate meaningful hypotheses for their studies. These can then be tested in a lab setting, driving new discoveries and breakthroughs.</li>
<li>Design Experiments: In addition to hypothesis generation, our tool can also assist in designing appropriate experiments. By providing a clear view of the host-pathogen interaction network, it helps researchers plan effective and efficient experimental designs.</li>
<li>Regular Updates and Improvements: We are continuously working to enhance our tool's accuracy and usability. Our users will benefit from ongoing updates and improvements to ensure they are always using the best possible prediction tool.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intended Users</h2>
<p>Deep-HPI-pred is designed to serve both experimental biologists studying host-pathogen interactions in a lab setting and bioinformaticians interested in computational approaches. The straightforward user interface ensures ease of use for all, regardless of computational expertise.</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>The app's UI contains several tab panels, each serving a distinct purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home: This panel provides an introduction to the application, and quick links to the app's GitHub repository, documentation, FAQ, and contact information.</li>
<li>Browse Search: In this panel, users can upload their own data or load demonstration data. The file format for uploading data is CSV and it should include UNIPROTKB identifiers.</li>
<li>Results: This panel displays the network visualization of the predicted interactions along with a downloadable data table of results.</li>
<li>GO Analysis: In this panel, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is performed, and the results can be visualized in plot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Server Logic</h3>
<ul>
<li>The server logic primarily revolves around handling user input and rendering results.</li>
<li>User file uploads are handled, ensuring data is properly loaded into the application.</li>
<li>The application also provides demonstration data that can be loaded with a button click.</li>
<li>Users can train the model and predict interactions with their data or the demonstration data.</li>
<li>The predicted interactions are then rendered as network visualizations.</li>
<li>GO enrichment analysis is performed and results are displayed as different plot types, which can be selected by the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Network Visualizations</h3>
<p>Network visualizations are created using the visNetwork package, with nodes representing proteins (colored differently based on whether they are host or pathogen proteins) and edges representing interactions between these proteins.</p>

<h3>GO Enrichment Analysis</h3>
<p>GO enrichment analysis provides a means of interpreting the functional aspects of the results. It is performed on the predicted interactions, and the results can be visualized in various ways.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>All results, including tables and plots, can be downloaded for further analysis or reporting purposes.</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>This application uses numerous libraries, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>shiny for building the web app.</li>
<li>visNetwork for network visualization.</li>
<li>igraph, tidygraph and ggraph for network analysis and visualization.</li>
<li>dplyr and tidyverse for data manipulation.</li>
<li>ggplot2 for data visualization.</li>
<li>magrittr for piping (%>%) functions.</li>
<li>httr and XML for handling HTTP requests and XML data.</li>
<li>tidyr for data tidying.</li>
<li>shinythemes for shiny themes.</li>
<li>DOSE for disease ontology semantic and enrichment analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
